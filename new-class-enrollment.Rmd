url_current <- "https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/files/fas-registrar/files/class_enrollment_summary_by_term_2.25.20_0.xlsx"

url_old <- "https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/files/fas-registrar/files/class_enrollment_summary_by_term_3.22.19_0.xlsx"

# destfile assumes you're already in the directory, so you're just specifying
# how you want to call the downloaded file

download.file(url = url_current, destfile = "current.xlsx")

download.file(url = url_old, destfile = "old.xlsx")


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
